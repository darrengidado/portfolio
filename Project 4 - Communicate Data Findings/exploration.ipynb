    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Ford GoBike is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. Beginning operation in August 2013 as Bay Area Bike Share, the Ford GoBike system currently has over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. On June 28, 2017, the system officially launched as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>Ford GoBike, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. The bikes are available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year and riders have access to all bikes in the network when they become a member or purchase a pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminary Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "This document explores the Ford GoBike's trip data for public containing approximately 1,850,000 bike rides from FY2018."

Plotting #bike trips throughout the day and #bike trips within the weekdays separately gave the impression that the demand for bikes is quite high throughout the day with a peak around 5pm which is not entirely true. The trend within weekdays for customers follows (although customers are rather not early birds) the one for subscribers who rent bikes mainly around commute hours (8-9am and 5-6pm). For customers, as depicted in univariate explorations, most of the trips happen on weekends but mainly between 10am - 8pm with the peak on Saturdays around 2pm, what was previosly not visible.\n",

There are not much of the differences in trends but surprisingly there are quite a lot of females using the system between January and March in comparison to males - the ratio (male:female) is much smaller than for the rest of the year. Moreover females take longer trips (measured in time) than males and others."
